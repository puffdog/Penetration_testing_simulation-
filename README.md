## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: This project is developed using Python.
- **Termux**: This project is intended to be run in the Termux environment on Android.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. **Install Termux**: Download and install Termux from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).

2. **Install Python**:
   ```bash
   pkg install python
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pentration-testing-simulation.git
   cd penetration-testing-simulation
   ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

The project includes three main scripts, each serving a different purpose in the penetration testing lifecycle:

1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Run the reconnaissance script to gather information about a target.
   ```bash
   python scripts/reconnaissance.py
   ```

2. **Scanning**:
   - Use the scanning script to identify open ports and services on the target.
   ```bash
   python scripts/scanning.py
   ```

3. **Exploitation**:
   - Execute the exploitation script to attempt exploiting vulnerabilities found in the scanning phase.
   ```bash
   python scripts/exploitation.py
   ```

### Example Output

The `examples/` directory contains sample outputs from various tools used during the testing phases, such as Nmap, Nikto, and Metasploit.

## Methodology

For detailed information on the penetration testing methodology employed in this project, refer to the [methodology.md](documentation/methodology.md) document.

## Tools Used

This project utilizes the following tools:
- **Nmap**: A powerful network scanning tool.
- **Nikto**: A web server scanner for identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploit**: A penetration testing framework for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Refer to the [tools.md](documentation/tools.md) document for installation instructions.

## Reporting

After conducting penetration testing, you can document your findings and recommendations in the [report.md](documentation/report.md) file.
